<p>Spring is coming, and it's time for the annual toothpick bridge competition.
	Dont watch your bridges collapse! Instead come to Maxwell Scientific for high-quality
	materials and adhesives. Maxwell Scientific also provides educational material to teach your
	students design the best structure. When it comes time to put those bridges to the test,
	look towards Maxwell Scientific for precision structure testers.
